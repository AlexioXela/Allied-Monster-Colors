# Allied Monster Colors

A Risk of Rain 2 mod to recolor allied units so they're easier to see, especially monsters so you know they're allied. Configurable, supports Risk of Options.

# Options

* Enable/disable whole mod
* Change the recolor color
* Change the recolor brightness
* Select who should be recolored
    * Just Queen's Gland Beetle Guards, in case they look too similar to normal Beetle Guards but you like how other allied monsters look by default.
    * All allied monsters (e.g. Happiest Mask ghosts)
    * Allied non-monsters (i.e. turrets/drones).
    * Allied players (if playing multiplayer).
    * Self (since you are your own ally, I suppose).

# Known Issues
* If you change who should be recolored mid-run, the update might not take for a given character until that character is hit (or you go to the next floor).
* If you enable the mod mid-run, the update might not take for a given character until that character is hit (or you go to the next stage).

# Other Notes
This mod has not been tested extensively yet. It hasn't been tested whatsoever for compatibility with other mods, though I'd like to think it should play nice with other mods.

I dabble in programming, but I don't really know what I'm doing. I made this project partially to practice programming/GitHub, and partially because modding is fun. And because those allied beetle guards look a little too close to the enemy beetle guards and I'm tired of shooting them. Feel free to submit an issue if you have a solution to a known issue, you have an issue not listed in the known issues, or if I've inadvertently done anything else problematic with this respository.
